### Password Generator App

The Password Generator app built with ReactJS is a tool designed to generate strong and secure passwords for users.

The main goal of the app is to generate passwords that are hard to guess, thereby enhancing the security of user accounts and personal information.

The functionality of the app includes:

1. Random Password Generation: The app generates passwords randomly, ensuring a high level of unpredictability. It uses various predefined character sets, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, to create a combination that meets the user's specified requirements.

2. Customization Options: The app allows users to customize the length and complexity of the generated passwords. Users can select the desired password length and specify which character sets to include or exclude, tailoring the password to their specific needs.

3. Copy to Clipboard: The app makes it easy for users to copy the generated password to the clipboard, eliminating the need to manually type it.
